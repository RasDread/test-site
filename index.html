    <p>
      Horse racing is an equestrian performance sport, typically involving two
      or more horses ridden by jockeys (or sometimes driven without riders) over
      a set distance for competition. It is one of the most ancient of all
      sports, as its basic premise - to identify which of two or more horses is
      the fastest over a set course or distance - has been mostly unchanged
      since at least classical antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>There are many types of horse racing, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>
        Flat racing, where horses gallop directly between two points around a
        straight or oval track.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jump racing, or Jumps racing, also known as Steeplechasing or, in the UK
        and Ireland, National Hunt racing, where horses race over obstacles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a
        sulky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Saddle Trotting, where horses must trot from a starting point to a
        finishing point under saddle
      </li>
      <li>
        Endurance racing, where horses travel across country over extreme
        distances, generally ranging from 25 to 100 miles (40 to 161 km).
        Anything less than 25 miles qualifies as a limited distance ride or LD.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Flat racing is the most common form of horse racing seen worldwide. Flat
      racing tracks are typically oval in shape and are generally level,
      although in Great Britain and Ireland there is much greater variation,
      including figure-of-eight tracks like Windsor and tracks with often severe
      gradients and changes of camber, such as Epsom Racecourse. Track surfaces
      vary, with turf most common in Europe and dirt more common in North
      America and Asia. Newly designed synthetic surfaces, such as Polytrack or
      Tapeta, are seen at some tracks.
